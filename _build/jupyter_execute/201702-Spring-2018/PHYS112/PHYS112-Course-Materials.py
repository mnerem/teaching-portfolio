#     total charge $Q$ on it and is placed inside a parallel plate
#     capacitor with plates separated by a distance $d=10\,$cm ($Q$ is a

#     drop is in equilibrium and "floats" in the space between the plates.
# 
#     1.  Draw a free body diagram of this problem and determine the net
#         force on the oil drop. Your diagram should include vectors
#         representing the forces acting on the drop.
