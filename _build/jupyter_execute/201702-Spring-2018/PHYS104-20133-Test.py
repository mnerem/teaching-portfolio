# 9. A muon in a rest-frame has a life time of $2.2\,\mu$s and light travels
#    less than a kilometer in that amount of time. If a muon is created in
#    the upper atmosphere ($100\,$km) why can we detect muons on the surface
#    of Earth?
#     * The atmospheric muons move near the speed of light and experience time dilation; 
#       allowing them to live longer (in our reference frame). 
#     * The atmospheric muons move near the speed of light and experience length contraction; 
#       stretching out to the Earth's surface (in our reference frame). 
#     * Muons are charged particles and Earth's magnetic fields boost the atmospheric muons to Earth's surface. 
#     * False, we do not detect muons on Earth's surface.
# 
# 10. What is the meaning of the phrase *inertial reference frame*?

#     * a reference frame that is accelerating at a constant rate 
#     * a reference frame in which there are strong gravitational forces
# 
# 11. An isolated white dwarf that started as a low mass star will eventually
#     * continue burning Hydrogen and Helium until it runs out of fuel. 
#     * grow cooler and cooler until it no longer emits any light. 
#     * explode as a Type Ia supernova. 
#     * explode as a Type II supernova.

# 
# 13. You are driving at 70 mi/h and another car is passing you. From your
#     point of view, the other car seems to advance at 10 mi/h, i.e., it is
#     slowly moving ahead of you. What is the speed that the odometer
#     indicates inside the other car?
# 
#

# 16. Which statement correctly describes variable stars?
#     * Variable stars with shorter periods have lower luminosities, so they can
#       only be observed when they are close. 
#     * Variable stars with longer periods have lower luminosities, so they can 
#       be observed when they are farther away.
#     * Variable stars with shorter periods have lower luminosities, so they can 
#       be observed when they are farther away. 
#     * Variable stars with longer periods have lower luminosities, so they can 
#       only be observed when they are close.
