**Course Description**: In this class, the continuation of PHYS111N, you will be 
introduced to further core topics in physics electricity, magnetism, light and optics and aspects
of modern physics. Through lectures, labs, reading and homework problem solving you
will learn how to describe simple physical processes in terms of the laws of physics in their
mathematical formulation.

**Prerequisites**: None

**Course Objectives**: This is an algebra-based course and without some command of this part
of mathematics you will not be able to proceed in the class. You are required to have
completed at least one of MATH102M, MATH162M, MATH166 or an equivalent. Furthermore, since
the concepts and methods developed in Phys111N will be used regularly, it is strongly 
recommended that you attain a grade of C or better in PHYS111N before taking PHYS112N.

**Required Materials**
```{admonition} **Course Textbook**
“(Sears & Zemansky’s) College Physics, Volume Two” by Hugh D. Young, 10th edition [Addison Wesley]
![PHYS112 Textbook](figures/phys112-textbook.jpg)

There are several options for the textbook and homework access:
- Chapters 17-30 are required for this class - they are available as a standalone volume or as part of the full-length textboook. In either case you will need access to MasteringPhysics
- Previous editions of the textbook may be available. If you acquire a used copy of the textbook you will need to also purchase access to MasteringPhysics from www.masteringphysics.com 
- There are e-text options available at www.masteringphysics.com
```
- Online Homework Access: “MasteringPhysics” Student Access Kit Contains a code required to access the online homework system at www.masteringphysics.com
- Clicker Questions: “Turning Technologies Response Card”. This device is available from the campus bookstore (ask at the counter) for around $50 and is required for classroom participation credit. You may already have this device from another class, if so you can reuse it here. Alternatively you may purchase an online pass and use your mobile device to submit answers during class. You will need to verify your clicker (or access code) is connected to your student ID on blackboard.
- Lab: “Physics 112 & 232 Laboratory Manual” This is available from the campus bookstore. You should check with your Lab TA if they require you to have any other materials.


**Homework**: The ability to analyze and solve problems is a very important skill to develop
during this course. You can only learn science by doing problems. Homework will be assigned
and managed though the MasteringPhysics online service. You must be sure to have the Stu-
dent Access Kit that comes with your copy of the course textbook - this contains a code that
allows you to register at the website www.masteringphysics.com. If you have bought a used
textbook you can purchase access to the homework system at www.masteringphysics.com.
If you took PHYS111N last semester, your MasteringPhysics account may still be active.
Homework will be assigned as the course progresses, typically once a week. Students should
regularly check the web site to be aware of homework due dates. Requests for submitting
homework late for legitimate reasons should be made within one week after the original due
date of the assignment. Once registered with the service you should put yourself on the
class-list for this course using the code MPNEREM75317. It is advisable to register in this
way as soon as you can.

**Laboratory Sessions**: Attendance & participation is required in the laboratory ses-
sions of the course and you must receive a passing grade in the lab in order to pass the
class. Any student with more than one missed lab session will fail the laboratory part of the
course and, hence, the entire course. An excused absence from a lab session can be made
up during makeup lab session weeks or by participating at a different lab session during the
same week. You must get permission from your lab instructor. If you cannot avoid missing
a lab session, contact the instructor in advance. You must hand in a lab report to get credit
for each session. The lab instructor will detail the format of lab reports and the grading
criteria to be applied.

**Examinations**: There will be **three** in class exams and one
cumulative final exam. Your lowest in class exam grade is dropped and
the remaining two account for 40% of your final grade (20% each). All
examinations are closed book and you should only bring a pen or pencil.

**Course Grade**: The following weighting will be used for the course

```{admonition} Course Grade Weights
    Laboratory Session       15%
    In class participation   10%
    Homework                 10%
    In class Exams           40% (20% each. Lowest score of the 3 in class exams is dropped)
    Final Exam               25%
```

Note there will be **three** in class exams and your lowest score will
be dropped for a total of three exams towards the course grade.
Therefore your final grade will be based on **two** in class exams, each
worth 20% of your final grade (the final exam cannot be dropped).

Final course letter grades will be assigned based on:

    A = 93% - 100%     B = 83% - 86.99%   C = 73% - 76.99%   D = 63% - 66.99% 
    A-= 90% - 92.99%   B-= 80% - 82.99%   C-= 70% - 72.99%   D-= 60% - 62.99% 
    B+= 87% - 89.99%   C+= 77% - 79.99%   D+= 67% - 69.99%    F = 0% - 59.99%
