**Course Description**: This four credit-hour course introduces the
basic concepts of astronomy. Emphasizes the study of stars, star
systems, cosmology and relativity. Emphasis on how we acquire knowledge
of celestial objects to develop models of our Universe.\
**Prerequisites**: None

**Course Objectives**: Students will learn basic techniques of
scientific investigation of objects in our galaxy and their underlying
physical principles. Emphasis is on the development of models of our
universe through a combination of instruction, in class participation,
performing laboratory work and possibly night observations, reading and
solving of homework problems.

The course consists of two weekly lectures, one weekly laboratory
session, homework assignments, three in class exams and one cumulative
final exam. Students will need to create an account for the online
homework system [Sapling Learning](https://www.macmillanlearning.com/college/us/digital/sapling), 
and clicker from Turning Technology. Detailed information and updates/changes 
can be found on the ODU Blackboard course web page.

  21st Century Astronomy: Stars and Galaxies
                         by L. Kay, S. Palen, G. Blumenthal, 5th edition,
                         W. W. Norton 2016 ISBN 978-0393603361

**Homework**: The ability to analyze and solve problems is a very
important skill to develop during this course. You can only learn
science by doing problems. Homework will be assigned and managed though
the Sapling Learning online service. You need to create an account at
the Sapling Learning web site.
Homework will be assigned as the course progresses, typically once a
week. Students should regularly check the Sapling Learning web site to
be aware of homework due dates. Requests for submitting homework late
for legitimate reasons should be made within one week after the original
due date of the assignment.

**Laboratory Sessions**: [Attendance & participation is required in the
laboratory sessions of the course and you must receive a passing grade
in the lab in order to pass the class]{style="color: red"}. Any student
with more than one missed lab session will fail the laboratory part of
the course and, hence, the entire course. An excused absence from a lab
session can be made up during makeup lab session weeks or by
participating at a different lab session during the same week. You must
get permission from your lab instructor. If you cannot avoid missing a
lab session, contact the instructor in advance. You must hand in a lab
report to get credit for each session. The lab instructor will detail
the format of lab reports and the grading criteria to be applied. Night
observations may be scheduled.

**Examinations**: There will be **three** in class exams and one
cumulative final exam. Your lowest in class exam grade is dropped and
the remaining two account for 40% of your final grade (20% each). All
examinations are closed book and you should only bring a pen or pencil.

**Course Grade**: The following weighting will be used for the course

```{admonition} Course Grade Weights
    Laboratory Session       15%
    In class participation   10%
    Homework                 10%
    In class Exams           40% (20% each. Lowest score of the 3 in class exams is dropped)
    Final Exam               25%
```

Note there will be **three** in class exams and your lowest score will
be dropped for a total of three exams towards the course grade.
Therefore your final grade will be based on **two** in class exams, each
worth 20% of your final grade (the final exam cannot be dropped).

Final course letter grades will be assigned based on:

    A = 93% - 100%     B = 83% - 86.99%   C = 73% - 76.99%   D = 63% - 66.99% 
    A-= 90% - 92.99%   B-= 80% - 82.99%   C-= 70% - 72.99%   D-= 60% - 62.99% 
    B+= 87% - 89.99%   C+= 77% - 79.99%   D+= 67% - 69.99%    F = 0% - 59.99%
