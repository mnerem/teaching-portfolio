## Laboratory Sessions

Science is an investigatory process. We must learn how to both collect
and analyze data in order to learn about the natural universe. To
achieve that goal there will be several laboratory experiments
throughout the semester that must be completed. Lab specific policies
and procedures are outline in the corresponding lab syllabus.

## Reading Notes

Research has consistently demonstrated that reading and writing are
important aspects in a successful education. Reading develops cognitive
skills, allowing students to process new information and therefore
improve their overall educational experience. While writing activates
regions of the brain that support long term memory. Towards these goals,
students will periodically upload scans of their reading notes of the
textbook. Your notes **must be handwritten** and uploaded through
Blackboard as a PDF document, non PDF file uploads for reading
assignments will receive a 10% penalty. Your notes should be no less
than one page in length for each upload and include your name on the
document.

## Homework

The ability to analyze and solve problems is an important skill to
develop during this course. You can only learn science by doing problems
and thinking critically. Knowledge is only achieved when one thinks
critically on a subject. *Not* by finding an answer online and blindly
accepting that as truth.

Homework will be delivered online through [The Expert
TA](https://theexpertta.com/). Details on how to sign up are provided in
the course's Blackboard page. Expert TA has a nominal subscription fee
of approximately \$35. If you have any issues registering for the
homework, please contact Expert TA support and your instructor
immediately. Students should regularly check the web site to confirm
homework due dates. Late assignments will receive a 5% penalty per day
late with a maximum penalty of 60%. The last day to submit any late
assignments is last the day of **lecture** in the course.

A tentative homework schedule is included on the last page.

## Examinations

There are a total of four test through out the semester (the last one
being a cummulative final exam). Test will be available online for a 24
hour period for students to take on the dates specified in the schedule.
If you have a conflict and cannot make the test time, you must contact
the instructor a minimum of 48 business hours prior to the test date and
take the test early. Any student that does not take a test prior to the
due date will automatically receive a zero for that test. **No late test
will be offered**.

Anyone committing an act of academic dishonesty (for example uploading
questions to solution help sites) will automatically receive a zero on
the examination, and are potentially subject to further repercussions
(following guidelines from the office of Student Conduct & Academic
Integrity).

## Submitting Work Policies

All documents for assignments must be uploaded to Blackboard as a PDF
file. If a non PDF file is uploaded for an assignment, that assignment
will not be graded and treated under the late submission policies. Any
work emailed to the instructor will not be graded, your submission only
counts if done through Blackboard.

The following table is quick reference for the penalties applied in the
unfortunate case that work is submitted late. Timeliness is an important
factor in the professional world and we must all strive to complete our
work in a timely manner.


  --------------- ----------------------------------------------
  Reading Notes   10% penalty per day late.
  Homework        5% penalty per day late, max penalty of 60%.
  Test            No makeup exams are offered.
  --------------- ----------------------------------------------

 Friday December 10, 2021 is last day to submit any work for the class.


# Required Materials

[OpenStax Astronomy](https://openstax.org/details/books/astronomy)\
OpenStax CNX. May 28, 2019\
The OpenStax is a free opensource textbook that is available online.
Print copies of the textbook can be purchase through the ODU bookstore
or directly from the OpenStax website.

Students must have access to a desktop computer or laptop that uses
Windows 10 or macOS as its operating system, along with tools that scan
physical documents for submission uploads. Course material is not
guaranteed to function properly on chromebooks, tablets, or smart-phone
devices. Instructor bears no responsibility for "technical issues" from
use of tablet or smart-phone electronics. A stable internet connection
is also required for the course. A webcam and microphone are highly
recommended tools to have. If you believe you may have difficulties with
the required materials you should contact your instructor immediately.

# Class Participation

Communicating with the professor and receiving active feedback is a
crucial part of any successful education. Students are encourage to ask
questions in class or through email. All lectures are available on the
course website. A general rule of any college courses is to expect 2--3
hours of work *outside* of class per credit hour. Applying this
heuristic to a four credit course, students should anticipate working
between 8 and 12 hours per week on class material in addition to
lectures. Any student that emails their professor a signed copy of this
syllabus and also describes their favorite scientific fact about the
universe will receive an additional five points of extra credit on the
first test of the semester. This offer only valid during the first week
of the semester. Students are expected to check their emails daily and
can find all announcements on the blackboard page. Everyone has a right
to an engaging educational experience. Anyone disrupting class will
receive one warning. Any future incidents and the student will be
immediately dismissed from the class. The instructor reserves the right
to assign groups, seats, etc. without warning or cause.

# Accommodation Statement

Students are encouraged to self-disclose disabilities that have been
verified by the Office of Educational Accessibility by providing
Accommodation Letters to their instructors early in the semester in
order to start receiving accommodations. Accommodations might not be
made until the Accommodation Letters are provided to the instructor.

# Honor Pledge

"*I pledge to support the honor system of Old Dominion University. I
will refrain from any form of academic dishonesty or deception, such as
cheating or plagiarism. I am aware that as a member of the academic
community, it is my responsibility to turn in all suspected violators of
the honor system. I will report to Honor Council hearings if I am
summoned.*" By attending Old Dominion University you have accepted the
responsibility to abide by this code. This is an institutional policy,
approved by the Board of Visitors.

# COVID-19 Response

## Face Coverings

Students that are on campus are required to wear face coverings in
accordance with the provisions set forth in ODU Policy 1006: COVID-19
(Interim Policy), especially in those instances when at least six feet
of physical separation cannot be maintained. The face covering must
cover the mouth and nose and must be worn at all times in the building
before, during, and after class. Students who have medical reasons that
prevent wearing a face covering **must meet** with the University's
Office of Educational Accessibility for alternative course delivery
solutions. Students who are disruptive in class about face coverings or
physical social distancing may not remain in class and will be referred
to the Office of Student Conduct & Academic Integrity.

## COVID Infection

If you are experiencing any symptoms of a possible COVID-19 infection or
have come into contact with someone with COVID-19, please do not come to
class. In addition, you must report your symptoms using the COVID-19
daily check-in text app. If you show symptoms, immediately self-isolate
and follow appropriate guidance on when and where to seek medical care.
Take every precaution to mitigate potential spread to fellow students,
ODU faculty, staff, and others in the community. If you need to
quarantine or isolate, please inform your instructor so that they can
adjust assignments and provide the level of support necessary to help
you succeed in class. Your professor will make accommodations to help
you learn the course material and succeed in the class if you are unable
to attend due to Covid-19. If necessary, your instructor will suspend
in-person classes for a 14-day period to reduce the possibility of
community spread. If the instructor shows signs of COVID-19 infection
and needs to quarantine or isolate, class will be immediately moved
online for a minimum of 14 days. Instruction will continue online until
the quarantine/isolation period has ended and/or conditions warrant a
return to in-person instruction. In the event of switching to an online
class format test will be delivered via a proctoring system of the
instructors choosing.

**Your best action, as a Monarch, is to protect you and your peers!**\
**If in doubt, immediately isolate and report symptoms of COVID-19.**

## Hybrid and Online Learning

This course may have to modify its in-person instruction based on
guidance from ODU and the Virginia Department of Health. It may entail
moving to an online format if COVID-19 infections require such a move.
Students should pay close attention to class announcements on Blackboard
for changes to course delivery.

# Contacting Professor

You can contact your professor in during their office hours, by
appointment, or by email (allow up to 48 business hours for a response
to email). Any email should include this courses CRN number in the
subject line to facilitate a timely response. Please note that email
communications with your instructor are formal interactions, not text
messages.
