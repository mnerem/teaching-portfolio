## Student Essay Responses

**What changes, if any, could be made to the class that would have helped you to learn more? What could the instructor have done to make the course an even better learning experience?**

```{toggle}
* Being able to convey the lectures in a way for us to understand more. Especially when it came to exam time, because either the study material did not match up or we were not grasping it.
* better powerpoints or more emphasis on which chapters corresponded to the topic of the powerpoint 
* better review
* Better study guide 
* Better study guides. 
* Don���t go so in depth with the subject 
* eliminate clickers. 
* everything is perfect so far.
* Explaining more and slowing down 
* For the professor to have gone over the material was in tests. Tests had nothing to do with his lecture. 
* having better study tools for the test. what we were given I feel like it really didn't help when it came down to the test.
* He could've made a clear study guide for the tests. I felt like I was always studying so much and it never paid off when it came to the tests. 
* He did great in doing so, but I feel like more in class examples would help more students understand the info better. Sometimes a power point presentation isn't enough and the instructor brought in his own equipment to do so, great on him.
* he did some experiments in the class to help students understand the class.
* He has already done very well, although this is his first teaching semester.
* He should grade homework strictly off effort and not accuracy since we have to pay $40$ for it. No reason we should be penalized for practice especially when we have to pay. 
* Hitting the mic and dropping the meter stick less often
* Hmm. Maybe have more tests? Only having like three (excluding the final) crams so much into one test and it can get a little stressful while studying for it.
* I think if the professor took more time out to allow questions and asked us if we understood what he was talking about, the material would be easier to grasp. He knew what he was talking about and was very passionate about the material, but because of this he went through the slides too quickly. Due to the fact he went through the slides so quickly, i feel like a lot of students felt intimidated to ask questions or did not have a chance to think about a question before moving on to the next topic.
* I think this course do not need to change. I learn a lot of knowledge in this class.
* I think with a large class it's hard to say more discussion based classes would have helped because it would be time consuming. 
* I would have liked it the class could have been smaller and if there were more times I could have met with the professor. 
* I would make it so that the clicker could be apart of the homework software
* I would not have gone straight from the PowerPoint and when using examples dumb them down a little so they are easier to understand. I would have more physical examples and information that keeps students engaged in the lecture, those were the best parts of the lecture. The tests also seemed overly difficult for the material that we were learning. It seemed as though the material given was more vague then the questions asked in the tests. 
* I would recommend the professor slow down his teaching. He rushes through the material trying to complete about 50 slides in one class period. He talks really fast and I could hardly understand the material. 
* I wouldn't want to change anything
* It moved at a bit of a fast pace, which made it a little challenging to keep up with the volume of the material.
* Make the lectures a little less boring, sometime it was hard to keep focus. The instructor could have gone over the material in a different way instead of just using a powerpoint to go by every class. 
* Maybe, if we went over homework during class or if the homework wasn't as complicated. More detailed study guides because the material is a lot and I've noticed the study guides you gave us weren't all that helpful for the first two tests. 
* More in class demos
* no changes 
* No changes really.
* none
* not charge the class for a service to do our homework.
* Nothing
* Professor Nerem could have explained how the class's lecture is going to function because there were many complaints in the beginning that information was unclear and the information focused more on physics rather than modern astronomy.
* Shorter time periods. I like what we were learning but would find myself comfortable in my seat. Maybe something more inter-active. It���s a big classroom full of already talkive students. Maybe using half the time to teach and half the time to converse over how it makes sense. 
* Show more videos that relate to the lecture. That would keep my interest more. 
* Simpler speaking. At times, the professor talked as if I was an Astronomer too, instead of simplifying things
* Slow down a little bit when going through the power point
* Something better than sapling learning.
* Sometimes there was more information given during lectures than needed which made it difficult to follow. The homework was a mess. There needs to be more consistency with due dates/time and late policy. I wasn't a fan of the clicker questions either. Let those kids who decide to show up benefit from doing better on tests rather than penalizing them for not knowing answers right away. Also, sometimes the technology wasn't working so I know I didn't get as many points as I should have. 
* Study guides that mirrored the exam
* Test review ( 1&2)
* The book I had to buy skipped chapters 15-23 which made up the entire second half of the course.
* The homework needs to be better at teaching concepts. Nothing.
* the tests should be online it would be easier for the instructor with grading
* there are not any changes i would make to the class.
* There's so much volume to learn, it would be nice if not so many chapters had to be covered.
* thinking
* Tone it down on the information. He presented good information but too much at one time.
* We didnt really use the clickers in which we paid a lot of money for
* what would have helped me learn more would have been actively listening to the lecture instead of writing or typing information. he could have shown movies that helped connect the lectures we were listening to. 
```

**What could you have done to make the course an even better learning experience?**

```{toggle}
* Again, I would put a more in-depht study guide for exams. 
* Ask more questions. 
* Asked for help more
* attend more classes
* because of priorities, I had to miss a couple classes. Other than that, being there is the only thing I think could have helped more personally. Instructor gave many opportunities for people to ask questions but a lot of the students were to nervous to ask questions out loud. Maybe have more office hours, or incentives, if you can allow. 
* been interested in science
* Been more engaging 
* been more interested in the material. 
* Come to more labs, but unfortunately I was out of town. 
* Could of taken better notes.
* I could have attended class more frequently.
* I could have attended classes more and if I didn't understand something I should have asked for his help in class instead of trying to figure it out on my own.
* I could have been more thorough in my readings, and done more to stay on top of the math so that I could be more comfortable with the equations.
* I could have participate more having come to class with questions that I researched about the fundamentals of astronomy or confusion of the texts from the assigned readings.
* I could have went into his office hours as a resource instead of trying to figure out things on my own. 
* i would have researched more on my own 
* If I had more knowledge of astronomy before I started the course.
* It was great 
* knowing more extra information about astronomy, such as films or books, will lead me to understand book knowledge more profoundly. 
* Made sure i completed all my homework by the due date 
* May be I could preview every chapter before the lecture.
* Maybe record the lectures 
* N/a
* Not much
* not sure
* not sure it was pretty good as is.
* Nothing
* Nothing really.
* Nothing, it was ok
* Nothing. 
* Overall, I believe that the professor was good and he knew what he was talking about, but since it was his first year teaching, I would have to say that he may need to change some things up for next year's class.
* Payed more attention
* paying attention to the class and finishing the homework. before the test, review the class materials.
* Probably going to tutoring
* Probably read the textbook, and took better notes. More in depth notes.
* studied even harder
* Studied more
* Studied more 
* Study a little bit more.
* Study more often and apply myself
* study more or go to office hours
* study the topic more in depth, have better study guides for exams 
* Take notes 
* thinking
* This course taught me a lot about natural phenomena.
* To make this coarse a better learning experience I could have read the text more often online. 
* To pay attention a little bit more

**What factors about this class contributed the most to your learning? What aspects of this class helped you to learn to think critically?**

```{toggle}
* A lot of material covered and expected to know the material. 
* Astronomy in general, I was not too bright in the subject prior to the class. studying for the test is what helped me to think critically. 
* Being a tough subject already made you think critically.
* Class was hard abd didnt mnow what to expect so i had to increase study time
* Course material and instructor���s teaching method
* Definitely the homework
* demonstrations
* Everything
* Going back to look at the notes
* He was very interactive despite such a large class.
* Him going over the material 
* his powerpoints were detailed but not overstuffed with information. His in-class demos also helped me visualize some concepts I couldnt wrap my head around
* I learned lots of knowledge about the universe and cosmology. 
* Just the PowerPoints and the labs helped further explain it 
* Lecture. 
* N/a
* none
* Powerpoints
* powerpoints helped me learn the homework made me think
* powerpoints helpful
* Professor Nerem teaches modern astronomy through the usage of physics and its fundamentals to better teach the class in increments. Once it came down to astronomical studies, professor Nerem uses a powerpoint to get the information across the large mass during the lecture.
* Teaching myself outside of class
* teaching style. Nerem is a good professor
* The class was overall interesting, which contributed heavily to my learning.
* the contents of courses are related to astronomy, which is hard for me to understand before. But, the professor taught us with my tools in order to make us understand. And there were many useful questions on class, which help me a lot absolutely. 
* The enthusiasm of the professor
* The fact that if you didn't come to class and go over the minerals then your grade for the class was not gonna be good. The teacher presented the materials in a way that it didn't give you the answer but it did give you enough to find the answer yourself.
* The hands-on experiments were very interesting and required critical thinking.
* The homework and labs
* the homework assignments helped me the most along with the labs 
* The homework contributed to most of my learning and also helped me to learn to think critically. 
* The homework definitely allowed the most to be learned from this class. Powerpoints are a hit or miss in a lot of classes, but being able to apply the material from the textbook to problems (ie. through the homework) was beneficial. 
* The homework, labs, and in-class demonstrations helped me the most. They helped to make the more abstract concepts more tangible to me.
* The homework.
* the illustrative slides and the lab portion
* The instructor's clear teaching method 
* The labs re-enforced what I had learned during lecture so that allowed me to get a deep understanding of the material allowing me to think critically. 
* The lecture 
* the material was hard and made me think harder
* the online homework helped me learn alot on my own. the essay questions on the exam allows me to think critically. 
* The organized lectures and PowerPoints were great.  Reading the textbook and doing the online sapling homework made you really think and learn things more deeply.
* The Physical examples, but they were representative of only a small amount of course material. 
* The power-points and the online hw 
* The powerpoint notes that where given during the class
* The powerpoint posted online. 
* The PowerPoints
* the professor's explain helps me a lot to learn the class. 
* The slide show he put together were very useful & the in class demos
* the teacher explained concepts very well. 
* The teacher was very enthusiastic and kept me intrigued on the subject
* thinking
* This class did not spark my interest at all. The only reason I took this class was because the other class I wanted was full. I did not learn much at all about astronomy. The class was very large and it was nothing but presentations the entire time. Most of the critical thinking I did was studying for the exams
* This class was somewhat difficult for me because of how the professor taught. I felt as if he knew the subject well, but this was not exactly his field of expertise for teaching. I felt as though the lab helped me more than the class setting itself.
* This course taught me a lot of basic knowledge about astronomy. It broke my previous understanding of astronomy. It also taught me some scientific principles.
* This was a challenging class, I took it merely to satisfy a science requirement. 
* Very good powerpoints and would help out if you needed help.
* We learned there is much more to our solar system than just stars. 
* What contributed most to my learning was the lab. I don't prefer large lectures and so the lab really helped me to understand things more concisely.
```

**What factors about your own performance helped you learn the most? What did you do to facilitate your learning?**

```{toggle}
* Accessing crash course videos, forming study groups, and doing the homework
* being able to go back at the lectures and actually learn more about the subject
* Doing the homework 
* Doing the homework consistently helped, as did making sure to show up for every lab. 
* Finding a friend in the class helped me perform the best. i studied more in the library to facilitate my learning. 
* Go to lectures and study
* Go to the library
* Going over the lecture powerpoints on blackboard, as well as working in study groups helped a lot. Furthermore, I used previous knowledge from Classical Astronomy 103N to help study with my peers who were new.
* Going to labs helped get a visual idea of the subject. The online homework was tough.
* going to the teacher for the extra help.
* I always do the homework at home and than review the powerpoint for the note.
* I attended all classes and was prepared.  I tried to be thorough with the reading and sapling homework.
* I come to all classes, and I would like to review the exam contexts before every test carefully.
* I completed the homework without the aid of google to help me understand more and read through my notes more. 
* I could have reviewed the notes more, after he posted them on blackboard. 
* I had to start paying attention better, using the online resources to do the homework, and studying with a partner. 
* I noticed that studying the slides alone wasn't enough. So, when I studying the homework as well as slides I noticed my grades were better. 
* I review every chapter after the class and do the homework on time, so I can learn lots of knowledge.
* I reviewed the class slides and learn more knowledge from the slides.
* I studied, but science isn't my thing. 
* I would say the lab helped me understand when the lecture did not. There was something about the hands on learning experience that helped the most.
* It was best for me to look over the class notes to better understand the material
* just being prepared for class and trying to understand the materials really helped me get the subject. I looked at powerpoints and even went online to find videos that could help me understand the concept better
* Just reviewing the homework. Seeing what I'd done wrong and learning from it.
* Just trying my best. 
* Listening during lectures.
* look over powerpoints and read
* looking over the powerpoints multiple times and the sapling learning and also staying on top of notes 
* My interest in the subject helped me learn
* N/a
* Not caring and studying for ten minutes before an exam
* Nothing
* Nothing. I spent a lot of time studying and doing homework yet I still did poorly on the test. 
* Overall I'm just fascinated with the topics in class, but his in class examples were the most engaging and brought a lot of light to topics that most did not understand. 
* researching while doing homework. i really enjoyed the material i learned in this class and the lab exercises helped me apply the material i learned in class. 
* Reviewing the powerpoints that were presented in class. I would study for hours prior to testing.
* Show up to class
* Studied 
* studied hard 
* Studied. 
* study groups
* study, do homework
* Studyinf
* Studying in a group of people who were all in the same class helped a lot. 
* studying on my own and learning the material from other sources. 
* the homework
* The homework and how to navigate the class in general.
* the lab
* The only way I was able to have a chance at passing the test was to study the review powerepoint over and over. The problem was the review powerpoints were way too long being 30-50 slides each. The final review being 115 slides.
* thinking
* Using the mathematics was a great review.
* You have to just care for what you are doing
