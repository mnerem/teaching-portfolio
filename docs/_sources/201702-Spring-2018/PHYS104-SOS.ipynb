    "* better review\n",
    "* Better study guide \n",
    "* Better study guides. \n",
    "* Don���t go so in depth with the subject \n",
    "* eliminate clickers. \n",
    "* everything is perfect so far.\n",
    "* Explaining more and slowing down \n",
    "* For the professor to have gone over the material was in tests. Tests had nothing to do with his lecture. \n",
    "* having better study tools for the test. what we were given I feel like it really didn't help when it came down to the test.\n",
    "* He could've made a clear study guide for the tests. I felt like I was always studying so much and it never paid off when it came to the tests. \n",
    "* He did great in doing so, but I feel like more in class examples would help more students understand the info better. Sometimes a power point presentation isn't enough and the instructor brought in his own equipment to do so, great on him.\n",
    "* he did some experiments in the class to help students understand the class.\n",
    "* He has already done very well, although this is his first teaching semester.\n",
    "* He should grade homework strictly off effort and not accuracy since we have to pay $40$ for it. No reason we should be penalized for practice especially when we have to pay. \n",
    "* Hitting the mic and dropping the meter stick less often\n",
    "* Hmm. Maybe have more tests? Only having like three (excluding the final) crams so much into one test and it can get a little stressful while studying for it.\n",
    "* I think if the professor took more time out to allow questions and asked us if we understood what he was talking about, the material would be easier to grasp. He knew what he was talking about and was very passionate about the material, but because of this he went through the slides too quickly. Due to the fact he went through the slides so quickly, i feel like a lot of students felt intimidated to ask questions or did not have a chance to think about a question before moving on to the next topic.\n",
    "* I think this course do not need to change. I learn a lot of knowledge in this class.\n",
    "* I think with a large class it's hard to say more discussion based classes would have helped because it would be time consuming. \n",
    "* I would have liked it the class could have been smaller and if there were more times I could have met with the professor. \n",
    "* I would make it so that the clicker could be apart of the homework software\n",
    "* I would not have gone straight from the PowerPoint and when using examples dumb them down a little so they are easier to understand. I would have more physical examples and information that keeps students engaged in the lecture, those were the best parts of the lecture. The tests also seemed overly difficult for the material that we were learning. It seemed as though the material given was more vague then the questions asked in the tests. \n",
    "* I would recommend the professor slow down his teaching. He rushes through the material trying to complete about 50 slides in one class period. He talks really fast and I could hardly understand the material. \n",
    "* I wouldn't want to change anything\n",
    "* It moved at a bit of a fast pace, which made it a little challenging to keep up with the volume of the material.\n",
    "* Make the lectures a little less boring, sometime it was hard to keep focus. The instructor could have gone over the material in a different way instead of just using a powerpoint to go by every class. \n",
    "* Maybe, if we went over homework during class or if the homework wasn't as complicated. More detailed study guides because the material is a lot and I've noticed the study guides you gave us weren't all that helpful for the first two tests. \n",
    "* More in class demos\n",
    "* no changes \n",
    "* No changes really.\n",
    "* none\n",
    "* not charge the class for a service to do our homework.\n",
    "* Nothing\n",
    "* Professor Nerem could have explained how the class's lecture is going to function because there were many complaints in the beginning that information was unclear and the information focused more on physics rather than modern astronomy.\n",
    "* Shorter time periods. I like what we were learning but would find myself comfortable in my seat. Maybe something more inter-active. It���s a big classroom full of already talkive students. Maybe using half the time to teach and half the time to converse over how it makes sense. \n",
    "* Show more videos that relate to the lecture. That would keep my interest more. \n",
    "* Simpler speaking. At times, the professor talked as if I was an Astronomer too, instead of simplifying things\n",
    "* Slow down a little bit when going through the power point\n",
    "* Something better than sapling learning.\n",
    "* Sometimes there was more information given during lectures than needed which made it difficult to follow. The homework was a mess. There needs to be more consistency with due dates/time and late policy. I wasn't a fan of the clicker questions either. Let those kids who decide to show up benefit from doing better on tests rather than penalizing them for not knowing answers right away. Also, sometimes the technology wasn't working so I know I didn't get as many points as I should have. \n",
    "* Study guides that mirrored the exam\n",
    "* Test review ( 1&2)\n",
    "* The book I had to buy skipped chapters 15-23 which made up the entire second half of the course.\n",
    "* The homework needs to be better at teaching concepts. Nothing.\n",
