### Research

Constructed experimental apparatus and was the first group to
    observe *Dynamical Hamiltonian Monodromy in a classical system*.
    Hamiltonian Monodromy is the study of topological properties of
    systems with multivalued action-angle variables. Dynamical Monodromy
    exploits the multivalued canonical variables to observe topological
    changes in a system. The apparatus is a spherically symmetric
    physical pendulum with a permanent magnet on the end of the
    pendulum. Electronics circuits were created that generate bipolar
    currents in coils surrounding the pendulum, producing magnetic
    fields that control the energy and angular momentum of the pendulum.
    Image acquisition was used to record the pendulum's position and
    momentum.

Studied the mathematical formalism of *symplectic geometry* to
    derive canonical symmetries of Hamiltonian systems, such as the
    action-angle variables. Using semiclassical techniques like the
    *WKB* approximation, the canonical variables can be appropriately
    quantized to determine approximate wave functions and eigenvalues
    for quantum mechanical systems. Current research interest is
    studying quantum mechanical systems with Hamiltonian Monodromy, the
    multivalued action-angle variables result in multivalued
    wavefunctions. Using Hamilton's optico-mechanical analogy, are their
    optical systems with Hamiltonian Monodromy?

Previous Work: Control growth techniques of *Boron-Nitride
    nanotubes* (BNNTs). Using *chemical vapor deposition* BNNTs can
    crystallize onto silicone substrates by heating a Boron powder in an
    Ammonia rich environment. Focus was controlling BNNTs physical
    characteristics (i.e. diameter and length) by coating substrates in
    nanometer thick layers of different metals. The thin layers was
    accomplished through *pulsed laser deposition* of target material.
